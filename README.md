# Efficient Browser History Tracker

This project is an efficient browser history tracker built using a custom Chrome extension, a Python server, and a Trie-based C++ program. The purpose is to capture, store, and retrieve browser history with optimized memory usage and quick access.

## Project Overview

This setup overcomes the limitations of traditional browser history storage by reducing redundancy and improving retrieval speed. Itâ€™s especially useful for tracking frequently accessed sites or performing customized analysis on browsing data.

## How It Works

1. **Chrome Extension**: Captures each visited URL and sends it to a local Python server in real-time.
2. **Python Server**: Receives URLs from the Chrome extension and appends them to `urls.txt`, creating a central log of visited sites.
3. **C++ Program**: Reads URLs from `urls.txt`, stores each URL in a Trie data structure for efficient tracking, and displays visit counts.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up the Python server** to start receiving URLs.
2. **Load the Chrome extension** in developer mode to begin capturing URLs as you browse.
3. **Run the C++ program** to monitor and display the URL history, along with visit counts.

## Benefits of This Project

- **Efficient Memory Usage**: The Trie structure minimizes redundancy by sharing common URL prefixes.
- **Quick Retrieval**: URLs can be accessed rapidly through the Trie, regardless of the history size.
- **Integrated Tracking**: Tracks visit counts directly, without the need for additional data structures.

This project provides a lightweight, scalable history-tracking solution that improves on traditional methods by offering faster access and custom tracking capabilities.
